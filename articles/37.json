The festival, which has been crowned one of the best fall events in the theme park industry, will transform the park with autumnal beauty including thousands of pumpkins, cornstalks, and stunning fall foliage that create an immersive autumn experience for guests.</p><h3>Great Pumpkin LumiNights Preparation Underway</h3><p>Preparations are intensifying for the award-winning Great Pumpkin LumiNights, which will illuminate the evening with over 12,000 pumpkins throughout the park. The event will feature thousands of creatively carved pumpkins and larger-than-life pumpkin icons, including a towering 40-foot pumpkin tree that will serve as a centerpiece during the evening festivities. Technical teams are working on the lighting systems that will create the whimsical warming glow that has made this event a regional favorite.</p><h3>New Candy Corn Country Takes Shape</h3><p>Construction and decoration work continues on the new Candy Corn Country, which will transform the Country Fair section of the park for the 2025 festival. This new addition will feature adorable characters and surprises themed around the polarizing Halloween candy, adding a playful new element to the Harvest Festival experience. The area represents Dollywood's continued innovation in creating unique seasonal attractions.</p><h3>Hoot Owl Hollow Returns with Enhancements</h3><p>Crews are preparing for the return of Hoot Owl Hollow, the enchanting hideaway featuring a gigantic glowing owl and dozens of its friends roosting in trees, atop buildings, and across the hillside. Visitors will once again be able to listen for the mystical melody of Dolly's glowing giant guitar, which has become a signature element of the fall festival experience.</p><h3>Entertainment and Culinary Preparations</h3><p>Entertainment teams are finalizing the lineup of Southern gospel, country, and bluegrass performers who will provide daytime entertainment during the festival. Meanwhile, culinary teams are developing menus featuring fall treats with the scents of apple and pumpkin that will waft through the streets. The combination of entertainment, decorations, and seasonal cuisine will create the comprehensive autumn experience that has earned the Harvest Festival its industry accolades.</p>"
