  "content": "<h3>Massive Pumpkin Installation Begins</h3><p>Dollywood crews have begun the large-scale installation of more than 12,000 real and faux pumpkins throughout the park in preparation for the Harvest Festival opening on September 12. The installation includes pumpkins of every shape, size, and color that will fill every corner of the park, requiring careful positioning and staging to create the comprehensive autumn atmosphere that has made the festival the country's best fall theme park event according to USA Today readers.</p><h3>Colossal Pumpkin Patch Installation</h3><p>Specialized crews are handling the installation of colossal pumpkins weighing nearly 1,000 pounds for the Colossal Pumpkin Patch presented by Food City. These massive specimens require specialized equipment and positioning techniques to create impressive displays while ensuring guest safety and optimal viewing opportunities throughout the festival's six-week run from September 12 through October 27.</p><h3>Master Artisan Carving Process</h3><p>The park has brought in the carvers of Maniac Pumpkin Carvers, whose creations have been displayed at The Museum of Modern Art and who have appeared on Good Morning America and The Chew among other shows. These master artisans, who were winners on the Food Network competition show Halloween Wars, will work on creating thousands of creatively carved pumpkins and larger-than-life pumpkin displays throughout the installation process.</p><h3>Technical Installation Requirements</h3><p>The pumpkin installation involves sophisticated technical elements, including weather-rated design systems that streamline the annual installation and removal of key elements. The process includes positioning pumpkins for optimal lighting effects, ensuring proper drainage and ventilation, and coordinating with electrical crews who will install the lighting systems that illuminate the displays during Great Pumpkin LumiNights.</p><h3>Specialized Display Construction</h3><p>Complex displays such as the Pumpkin Sunflower Field require extensive preparation, with carving each stalk taking up to two hours plus additional build time needed to stack the pumpkins and lights to complete each 'flower.' The installation process includes constructing the centerpiece 40-foot tall pumpkin tree, described as a massive mountain of glowing pumpkins that will serve as the focal point for the award-winning Great Pumpkin LumiNights experience.</p>"
