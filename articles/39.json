  "content": "<h3>Major Infrastructure Improvements Complete</h3><p>Dollywood's 40th anniversary year has featured more than 100 improvements throughout the park, with major infrastructure projects now serving guests during the peak operating season. The new 750-space parking lot has opened to help accommodate increased visitor capacity, while the Wilderness Pass Restaurant provides expanded dining options with rotisserie chicken, smoked meats, braised beef, and classic sides like mac and cheese and hush puppies.</p><h3>Country Fair and Village Area Refreshes</h3><p>Two of Dollywood's older themed areas, The Village and Country Fair, received comprehensive refreshes during the off-season that are now fully visible to guests. The Country Fair improvements include a new splash pad for families, expanded seating areas, enhanced building facades, and bright colors that bring new life to the area. These updates represent part of the ongoing maintenance philosophy that park leadership compares to home maintenance, addressing areas that need refreshing and new elements.</p><h3>Continuous Improvement Philosophy</h3><p>According to Dollywood President Eugene Naughton, the park's approach to improvements follows a home maintenance model where different areas receive attention as needed. This philosophy ensures the park maintains its high standards while continuously updating facilities and attractions. The more than 100 projects completed for the 40th anniversary demonstrate this commitment to ongoing enhancement rather than waiting for major renovations.</p><h3>Future Construction Visible Throughout Park</h3><p>Guests visiting during this period may notice ongoing construction for the major new attraction planned for 2026, which carries an expected investment of $50 million. While details of this attraction have not been announced, the visible construction work represents Dollywood's commitment to continued expansion and innovation as it moves beyond its 40th anniversary year.</p><h3>Maintenance Excellence During Operating Season</h3><p>The successful completion of major improvements while maintaining full park operations demonstrates Dollywood's operational expertise in managing large-scale projects without disrupting the guest experience. Unlike some theme parks that conduct major maintenance during extended closure periods, Dollywood has managed to implement significant improvements while continuing to operate its festival schedule and maintain high guest satisfaction standards throughout the anniversary season.</p>"
