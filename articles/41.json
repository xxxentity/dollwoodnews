  "content": "<h3>Marketing Campaign Emphasizes Fall Transformation</h3><p>Dollywood's marketing campaign for the Harvest Festival presented by Humana promotes the park's transformation into an autumn wonderland in the Great Smoky Mountains with the tagline 'Fall glows brightest at Dollywood during the Harvest Festival presented by Humana, where crisp autumn days burst with vivid color, and magical nights shimmer with illuminating surprises.' The campaign emphasizes the September 12 through October 27 dates and the comprehensive fall experience available throughout the six-week festival.</p><h3>New Candy Corn Country Featured in Promotions</h3><p>A major focus of the 2025 marketing campaign is the debut of Candy Corn Country, where the Country Fair section transforms into a fanciful area celebrating the colorful fall treat. Marketing materials describe this playful area where 'fun and sweetness grow together to create lifelong family memories in shades of yellow, white and orange,' positioning it as a unique addition that differentiates the 2025 festival from previous years.</p><h3>Award-Winning Great Pumpkin LumiNights Highlighted</h3><p>The marketing campaign prominently features Great Pumpkin LumiNights, which has been named the theme park industry's best fall event and winner of the 10Best Reader's Choice Award for Best Theme Park Event. Promotional materials emphasize the transformation 'from day to night' as Dollywood becomes 'a glowing wonderland' featuring more than 12,000 pumpkins that fill every corner of the park during the evening experience.</p><h3>Media Outreach and Advertising Strategy</h3><p>Dollywood is actively accepting Harvest Festival promotion requests for the 2025 season as part of their media outreach efforts. The park works with Allied Global Marketing as their media buying agency for advertising opportunities throughout the season, demonstrating a professional approach to marketing distribution across various media channels.</p><h3>Awards and Recognition Emphasized</h3><p>The marketing campaign leverages Dollywood's recent accolades, including being named by TripAdvisor as the #1 theme park in the country in 2022, 2024, and 2025, along with winning 64 Golden Ticket Awards. These recognitions provide credibility to promotional messages about the quality of the Harvest Festival experience and help differentiate Dollywood's fall offering from competing attractions in the region.</p>"
