  "content": "<h3>Historic Early Release Sets New Park Precedent</h3><p>Dollywood made history on September 17, 2025, by launching 2026 season pass sales earlier than ever before in the park's four-decade existence. Current season passholders gained immediate access to renew their passes for the upcoming year, while the park simultaneously opened pre-sale registration for new customers seeking to join the passholder community. This unprecedented early timing coincides with the announcement of NightFlight Expedition, demonstrating Dollywood's confidence in strong demand for next year's enhanced guest experience featuring the groundbreaking new attraction.</p><h3>Two-Phase Pre-Sale Structure Benefits All Customers</h3><p>The 2026 season pass program operates through a carefully structured timeline designed to reward loyalty while welcoming new members. Current passholders enjoy exclusive renewal access through October 12, followed by the new passholder pre-sale beginning October 13 with exclusive early access before general public sales commence. Prospective new passholders must complete pre-sale registration by October 5 to secure their opportunity for early access, providing first-time buyers with advance notice and preparation time for the upcoming sales window.</p><h3>Enhanced Value Proposition Includes Exclusive Attraction Access</h3><p>The 2026 season passes offer unprecedented value through early access to NightFlight Expedition, Dollywood's most ambitious attraction investment totaling over $50 million. Current passholders receive the additional benefit of experiencing the hybrid coaster and whitewater ride before its public opening, adding exclusive preview privileges to the comprehensive season pass benefits package. The online payment plan enables customers to spread costs across manageable monthly installments, making the enhanced 2026 experience accessible to more families planning extended visits throughout the upcoming season.</p><h3>Registration Requirements Ensure Communication Access</h3><p>New passholder pre-sale registration requires complete contact information including name, email address, phone number, full address, and intended number of passes ranging from one to twenty. Registrants must maintain active email communication preferences with Dollywood Parks and Resorts to receive pre-sale access notifications and purchase instructions when the October 13 window opens. The registration system ensures qualified customers receive timely access while enabling the park to communicate important updates about the 2026 season and new attraction details as they become available.</p><h3>Strategic Timing Leverages NightFlight Expedition Excitement</h3><p>The earliest-ever season pass release strategically capitalizes on heightened excitement surrounding NightFlight Expedition, the world's first hybrid coaster and whitewater river ride experience. By offering 2026 passes immediately following the attraction announcement, Dollywood positions itself to capture strong initial demand while providing customers maximum planning time for next year's visits. The early sales launch reflects management confidence in the new attraction's appeal and reinforces Dollywood's commitment to providing exceptional advance value for loyal guests planning multiple visits to experience the revolutionary four-in-one ride adventure.</p>"
