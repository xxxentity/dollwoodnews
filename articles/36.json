  "content": "<h3>Park Operations Continue Without Festival</h3><p>Dollywood has entered its transition period following the August 3rd conclusion of the Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration, with the park continuing regular operations while preparations begin for the upcoming Harvest Festival. This approximately five-week gap between major seasonal festivals allows the park to maintain daily operations while crews work behind the scenes to transform the park from summer to fall theming.</p><h3>Fall Transformation Process Begins</h3><p>The transition from summer to fall programming at Dollywood involves extensive changes throughout the park, including the removal of summer decorations and the preparation for autumn displays. The park will soon begin receiving shipments of the more than 12,000 pumpkins that will be featured during the Harvest Festival and Great Pumpkin LumiNights, along with cornstalks, hay bales, and other fall decorations that will transform the park's appearance.</p><h3>Regular Park Schedule Maintained</h3><p>During this transition period, Dollywood maintains its regular operating schedule without the extended hours that characterized the Summer Celebration. The park continues to offer its permanent attractions and shows, though without the special seasonal entertainment that defined the summer months. This period provides guests with opportunities to enjoy the park's core offerings while avoiding the peak crowds associated with major festival periods.</p><h3>Preparation for Award-Winning Fall Event</h3><p>Behind the scenes, teams are preparing for the Harvest Festival presented by Humana, which has been recognized as one of the best fall events in the theme park industry. The preparations include planning for the award-winning Great Pumpkin LumiNights, which will illuminate the evening with thousands of creatively carved pumpkins, and the new Candy Corn Country area that will debut in the Country Fair section of the park.</p><h3>Entertainment Teams Rehearse Fall Shows</h3><p>While the park operates in transition mode, entertainment teams are beginning rehearsals for the fall performance schedule that will feature Southern gospel, country, and bluegrass performers during the Harvest Festival. Technical crews are also preparing for the installation of the 40-foot pumpkin tree that will be featured exclusively during Great Pumpkin LumiNights, along with Hoot Owl Hollow's glowing owl displays that have become a signature element of Dollywood's fall celebration.</p>"
