  "content": "<h3>Summer Celebration Reaches Finale</h3><p>Dollywood's Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration presented by Food City concludes today, August 3, 2025, marking the end of nearly two months of extended summer programming that began on June 14. The celebration, which has been a centerpiece of Dollywood's 40th anniversary season, featured the Sweet Summer Nights drone and fireworks show that combined modern drone technology with traditional pyrotechnics to create a spectacular evening experience for park guests.</p><h3>Seasonal Entertainment Takes Final Bows</h3><p>Popular summer shows including the Gazillion Bubble Show Aurora and Perondi's Stunt Dog Experience present their final performances today as part of the Summer Celebration's conclusion. The Play On show, which celebrates Dollywood's music and legacy, also wraps up its summer run. These seasonal entertainments have been key attractions throughout the summer, with multiple dance parties in Wildwood Grove adding to the festive atmosphere that has characterized the 2025 summer season.</p><h3>Extended Hours End with Summer Festival</h3><p>The extended park hours that have been a hallmark of the Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration come to an end today, with the park having offered guests extra time to enjoy rides and attractions during the peak summer months. These extended hours allowed families to make the most of every sun-kissed day and sweet summer night, avoiding the heat of midday while enjoying the park's offerings in cooler evening temperatures.</p><h3>Resort Activities Conclude Summer Programming</h3><p>Dollywood's DreamMore Resort and Spa and Dollywood's HeartSong Lodge & Resort conclude their special summer activities today, including daily crafts, watercolor painting, pool parties, field days, bedtime stories and nightly s'mores that have been offered throughout the Summer Celebration. These resort activities have provided additional entertainment options for overnight guests, extending the Dollywood experience beyond the theme park gates.</p><h3>Transition Period Begins Tomorrow</h3><p>With the Summer Celebration ending today, Dollywood enters a transition period before the Harvest Festival begins on September 12. During this approximately five-week period, the park will continue regular operations without a major seasonal festival, allowing time for the transformation from summer to fall theming that will include the installation of thousands of pumpkins and autumn decorations throughout the park.</p>"
