The pre-festival setup includes staging areas, technical installations, and coordination of the complex logistics required to manage over 12,000 pumpkins and extensive seasonal decorations throughout the six-week festival.</p><h3>Performance Venue Preparation</h3><p>Technical crews are completing final preparations for the more than 700 live performances featuring over 140 artists that will take place during the festival. Stage areas, sound systems, and lighting equipment require precise calibration to support the extensive entertainment lineup spanning Southern gospel, bluegrass, country, and Americana genres scheduled throughout the September 12 through October 27 festival period.</p><h3>Candy Corn Country Final Touches</h3><p>The new Candy Corn Country area in the Country Fair section receives final theming touches, with crews installing the colorful themed elements celebrating the Halloween candy. This new addition for 2025 features adorable characters and seasonal surprises in the traditional candy colors of yellow, white, and orange, requiring specialized installation work to create the fanciful candy-themed environment.</p><h3>Logistics Coordination Complete</h3><p>Final logistics coordination includes staging delivery schedules for the massive quantities of real and faux pumpkins that will fill every corner of the park, including colossal pumpkins weighing nearly 1,000 pounds for the Colossal Pumpkin Patch presented by Food City. Storage areas have been prepared to handle the volume of materials required for the comprehensive festival transformation.</p><h3>Behind the Glow Tour Preparation</h3><p>Special preparations are underway for the Behind the Glow guided tours that will offer guests a behind-the-scenes look at the Great Pumpkin LumiNights setup process. These tours will showcase the lighting and special effects installations, providing exclusive experiences and keepsakes while demonstrating the complexity involved in creating the award-winning fall experience that has been recognized as the theme park industry's best fall event.</p>"
